**Room:** TryHackMe ‚Äì Pre-Security Room 2 Networking [FINISHED]

---

## üß† What I Learned:
- Spoofing is IP mimicry. Can be used to mimic someone elses MAC Address for advantage. ex: spoofing
  a paid wifi user MAC Address as to not pay for the wifi on a hotel/airport etc.
- Octets are what you call the numbers separated within an IP. ex: 192.168.1.3 = 4 octet sets.
- MAC stands for "Media Access Control"
- "Ping" is a command that can be used to determine the performance of a connection between devices.
- Learnt a lot about networks, TCP, UDP, the OSI Layers, each layer individually.
- Jarvis explained VPN's to me and proxy's.
- Learnt some about firewalls and how they work, Stateful and Stateless

## ‚ùì What Confused Me:
- Still trying to grasp networks more in depth, I find it fascinating but I noticed that the more I learn the deeper it gets.
once I finally grasped the TCP and UDP quite well, I found out I knew nothing about it as the more in-depth the more complex it gets.
